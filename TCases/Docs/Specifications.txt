Example 1: System: "Examples", function: "find"

         Usage: find pattern file

         Locates one or more instances of a given pattern in a text file. 

         All lines in the file that contain the pattern are written to standard output. A
         line containing the pattern is written only once, regardless of the number of
         times the pattern occurs in it.

         The pattern is any sequence of characters whose length does not exceed the
         maximum length of a line in the file. To include a blank in the pattern, the
         entire pattern must be enclosed in quotes ("). To include a quotation mark in the
         pattern, two quotes in a row ("") must be used.


Example 2: System: "Examples", function: "addShape" 

        Usage: add shape

        This function is designed for adding shapes, and each test case within it is annotated with metadata such as page type, page name, and page value. 
        The input section captures variables related to shape creation, including "Type" (indicating the shape type with possible values SQUARE, CIRCLE, or LINE), "Size" (representing the size with values 1, 10, or 100 with an additional property "Large" for the latter), and "Color" (indicating the color with possible values red, green, or blue). 
        Each variable is annotated with its type, name, and application method. 
        The function serves as a flexible tool for testing shape creation with various attributes, providing a clear and structured approach for defining test cases and expected outcomes.


Example 3: System: "Ice-Cream", function: "Cones"

        Usage: Configure and categorize ice cream cones

        Cone specifies the type of ice cream cone and its characteristics based on the number of scoops and toppings.
        The cone can be categorized into different types: Empty, Plain, Plenty, Grande, and Too-Much.
        - Empty: Represents an invalid cone if the number of scoops is less than 1.
        - Plain: Indicates a cone with one scoop and optionally one topping.
        - Plenty: Represents a cone with one or two scoops and optionally up to two toppings.
        - Grande: Denotes a large cone with up to four scoops and one to three toppings.
        - Too-Much: Represents an invalid cone with excessive scoops (more than 2) or insufficient toppings (less than 4).
        The cone type is determined based on the given conditions for the number of scoops and toppings. 
        The specification provides a comprehensive guide for configuring and categorizing ice cream cones with clear conditions for validity and inclusion of flavors and toppings.
